After obtaining the crystallographic orientation, to select the strain fringe domain, an area
[0.3*max(ebsd.x) 0.2*max(ebsd.y) 0.5*max(ebsd.x) 1*max(ebsd.y)]　(line 52 in both GrainsizeCalculation for Crossetal.2017)
was used for grain size estimation.

Grain size and grain boundary estimation were performed using GrainsizeCalculation for Crossetal.2017.

The entire area was used for grain size estimation.
Grain size and grain boundary estimation were performed using GrainsizeCalculation for Crossetal.2017.

The fabric pattern presented in the paper is a synthesis of three sets of data.
For each data, the entire area was applied to GrainsizeCalculation for Crossetal.2017, and
Rexnonborder was plotted on the Schmidt net using PlotforOA.

The obtained fabric pattern was rotated by -70° around the y-axis (z-axis on the program), taking into account the direction of crystallographic orientation measurement.

The figure presented in the paper was further rotated by 90° around the z-axis (or y-axis in the program), as the fabric pattern was clearly observed.
The OA before rotation was also around 47°, which is almost the same result.

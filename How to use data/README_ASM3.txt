●Grain size●

To exclude the influence of phyllosilicate minerals, an area
[0*max(ebsd.x) 0.1*max(ebsd.y) 0.87*max(ebsd.x) 1*max(ebsd.y)]  (line 52 in both GrainsizeCalculation for Crossetal.2017 and GrainsizeCalculation for Shimizu2012) was used for grain size estimation.
Grain size and grain boundary estimation were performed using both GrainsizeCalculation for Crossetal.2017 and GrainsizeCalculation for Shimizu2012.

●Fabric pattern and OA●

The fabric pattern presented in the paper is a synthesis of two sets of data.
For each data, the entire area was applied to GrainsizeCalculation for Shimizu2012, and
Nonbordergrain was plotted on the Schmidt net using PlotforOA.

This sample has a low indexing rate due to mica minerals. To obtain a sufficient number of particles, the KNEE of the indexing rate is set to KNEE/1.5 (line 117 in GrainsizeCalculation for Crossetal.2017). 

The plotted fabric pattern was rotated 10° around the x-axis so that the girdle intersections were oriented towards the y-axis (z-axis on the program).

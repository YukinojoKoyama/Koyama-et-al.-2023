After obtaining crystallographic orientation, to exclude the influence of phyllosilicate minerals, an area
[0*max(ebsd.x) 0.1*max(ebsd.y) 0.8*max(ebsd.x) 0.85*max(ebsd.y)]　(line 52 in both GrainsizeCalculation for Crossetal.2017 and GrainsizeCalculation for Shimizu2012)
of XZ plane, and an area
[0*max(ebsd.x) 0.1*max(ebsd.y) 1*max(ebsd.x) 0.7*max(ebsd.y)] (line 52 in both GrainsizeCalculation for Crossetal.2017 and GrainsizeCalculation for Shimizu2012) of YZ plane was used for grain size estimation.
Grain size and grain boundary estimation were performed using both GrainsizeCalculation for Crossetal.2017 and GrainsizeCalculation for Shimizu2012.

The fabric pattern presented in the paper is a synthesis of three sets of data.
For each data, the entire area was applied to GrainsizeCalculation for Shimizu2012, and
Nonbordergrain was plotted on the Schmidt net using PlotforOA.
